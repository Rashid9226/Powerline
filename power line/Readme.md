In the present scenario power line communication (PLC) is one of the economical ways of communication of data. Even though there are new methods of wireless communication methods, practically it is very much time consuming to install such a system, and also it is highly cost consuming method. But the power lines which already exist and connect every household in a particular area is more advantageous as it does not require any new installation or erection for establishment of communication channels, and thus is not a time consuming one. One biggest advantage of this system is that it can be readily implemented, unlike the other modern methods. The power line network can also be used for creating emergency response networks. This project eliminates the need for employing KSEB meter readers and this set of employees can be used elsewhere.The long queues in the billing counter can be avoided by implementing this model. Also the control of the system is fully automated by this technique. The most important feature in this system is the use of digital meters consisting of micro controllers and real time clock, thus eliminating the loss of meter data during power failure.
